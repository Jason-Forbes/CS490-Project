## Delete once we all have the environment set up

This is the branch for the login page that actually asks for information.  It can be used for both instructor and student views.

CSS changes made on this branch will also be added to the test-branch.

To-Do List:
1. "Login" Button
2. General maintenance/colorizing
3. Organize css file by page??? Maybe?
